Hello, this is my repo for API automation using cypress, mocha and supertest

I already create API automation for endpoint :
- Create category product
- Update category product

- Create User login

Before run this code, make sure you have already installed :

```
- npm init
- npm install supertest
- npm install mocha
- npm install chai
- npm install mochawesome

```

After you install all package, you must create .env in your file and the create variabel

```
BASE_URL=yourAPI
```

```
npm run test test/[filename].js
```
