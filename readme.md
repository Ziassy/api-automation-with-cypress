# API Automation using Mocha, Chai, Supertest
Hello, this is my repo for API automation using Chai, mocha and supertest

I already create API automation for endpoint :
- Create category product
- Update category product
- Delete category product
- Get detail category product
- Create User login

Before run this code, make sure you have already installed :

```
- npm init
- npm install supertest
- npm install mocha
- npm install chai
- npm install mochawesome
- npm install dotenv
```

After you install all package, you must create .env in your file and then create variabel

```
BASE_URL=yourAPI
```


Last you can run with test like this : 
```
npm run test test/[filename].js
```

Here screen record for run the test :
